            <p class="font-italic lead text-center font-weight-bold">May the force be with you!</p>
            <p>Star Wars is still one of the leading blockbuster hits of all time. With the releases of Episodes 1, 2 and 3 and the current releases of 7, 8 and 9, Star Wars is once again gaining momentum in pop culture. However, we cannot let the fancy visual effects and stunning action sequences take away from the true meaning: the story. This is why Episodes 4, 5, and 6 are, and forever will be, the best Star Wars trilogy.</p>

            <h4>The Value of a Good Story</h4>
            <p>Many know that George Lucas created many of the effects used in the Trilogy. At the time of release, Star Wars was on the cutting edge of visual effects and computer graphics. However, as time progressed, effects got better, but the cost did as well. We will compare the overall income produces vs. the cost of production.</p>

                    <p>
                            Luke Skywalker was a Tatooine farmboy who rose from humble beginnings to become one of the greatest Jedi the galaxy has ever known. Along with his friends Princess Leia and Han Solo, Luke battled the evil Empire, discovered the truth of his parentage, and ended the tyranny of the Sith. A generation later, the location of the famed Jedi master was one of the galaxy’s greatest mysteries. Haunted by Ben Solo’s fall to evil and convinced the Jedi had to end, Luke sought exile on a distant world, ignoring the galaxy’s pleas for help. But his solitude would be interrupted – and Luke Skywalker had one final, momentous role to play in the struggle between good and evil.

                    <p>
                        Princess Leia Organa was one of the Rebel Alliance’s greatest leaders, fearless on the battlefield and dedicated to ending the tyranny of the Empire. Daughter of Padmé Amidala and Anakin Skywalker, sister of Luke Skywalker, and with a soft spot for scoundrels, Leia ranks among the galaxy’s great heroes. But life under the New Republic has not been easy for Leia. Sidelined by a new generation of political leaders, she struck out on her own to oppose the First Order as founder of the Resistance. These setbacks in her political career have been accompanied by more personal losses.

                        Han Solo rose from an impoverished childhood on the mean streets of Corellia to become one of the heroes of the Rebel Alliance. As captain of the Millennium Falcon, Han and his co-pilot Chewbacca came to believe in the cause of galactic freedom, joining Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia Organa in the fight against the Empire. After the Battle of Endor, Han faced difficult times in a chaotic galaxy, leading to a shattering confrontation with his estranged son Ben.

                            Discovered as a slave on Tatooine by Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker had the potential to become one of the most powerful Jedi ever, and was believed by some to be the prophesied Chosen One who would bring balance to the Force. A hero of the Clone Wars, Anakin was caring and compassionate, but also had a fear of loss that would prove to be his downfall.
